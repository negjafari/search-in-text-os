l cost of path through n to goal. 
A heuristic h(n) is admissible if for every node n,    h(n) â‰¤ h*(n), where h*(n) is the true cost to reach the goal state from n.
An admissible heuristic never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, i.e., it is optimistic
Example: hSLD(n) (never overestimates the actual road distance)
Theorem: If h(n) is admissible, A* using TREE-SEARCH is optimalhey there i fucking hate working with files

Evaluation function f(n) = h(n)
h(n): heuristic function
h(n): estimated cost of the cheapest path from node n to goal node.
If n is goal then h(n)=0
Greedy best-first search expands the node that appears to be closest to goal
Example: hSLD(n) = straight-line distance from n to Bucharest
General approach of informed search:
Best-first search: node is selected for expansion based on an evaluation function f(n)
